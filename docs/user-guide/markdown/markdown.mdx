## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way of formatting text on the internet, similar to how you would use bold, italics, and different font sizes in a word document. It uses simple symbols and keywords to make text look different, for example, you can make text bold by putting two asterisks (*) around a word or phrase. You can also create headings, lists, and links using similar symbols.

## Why use Markdown?

Anyone interested in contributing and editing the Wiki should have a *basic understanding of Markdown*. However, don't worry, Markdown is user-friendly and this guide is always available to reference for assistance.

## Overview

This guide is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Markdown and its basic features within the context of Docusaurus, a static-site generator. We will not be covering advanced features that may be difficult for those without prior coding experience to understand. The guide will be divided into two sections: **basic** and **advanced**.

The **basic section** will cover the fundamental formatting elements such as headings, lists, links, and emphasis (bold and italic) which are commonly used. These elements are easy to learn and use, making them perfect for beginners.

The **advanced section** will delve into additional formatting options that are not covered in the basic section. These may include tables, code blocks, task lists, and more. This section is intended for users who are looking to expand their knowledge and skills with Markdown.
