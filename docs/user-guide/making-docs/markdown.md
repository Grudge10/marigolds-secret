# Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way of formatting text on the internet, similar to how you would use bold, italics, and different font sizes in a word document. It uses simple symbols and keywords to make text look different, for example, you can make text bold by putting two asterisks (*) around a word or phrase. You can also create headings, lists, and links using similar symbols.
